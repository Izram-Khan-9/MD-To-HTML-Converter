# MD to HTML Converter

A small Python script that converts Markdown (`.md`) files into HTML (`.html`) files.

## 🚀 Features

* Convert any `.md` file into a clean `.html` file
* Handles missing files with friendly error messages
* Simple and easy to use

## 📦 Requirements

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install markdown
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The script reads your Markdown file
2. Converts it to HTML using the `markdown` module
3. Saves the final output as an `.html` file

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
Your HTML file will appear in the same folder.
